I think selecting a school should work a bit like logging in:
- Once you select a school you are now searching for that school only.
- If you select the home button, you are brought to the building selection page for your school
- From there, you can choose to "logout" of your school to select another one
- School could be stored in cookies
- This will make it easy to start with just UMass, as the homepage will be UMass's homepage


We probably want to prevent people from booking multiple rooms. This implies a few things:
1. People should be able to "sign out" of rooms in case they decide to leave early but still want to sign in to another rooms
2. Does this mean that people need to sign in? In order to prevent people from booking twice on incognito or something.
3. I think it makes sense to prevent people from booking unless they log in but anyone can view.
4. We could also use Captcha I suppose.
